Which of the following statements about abstract superclasses is true?
Correct Answer
  abstract superclasses may contain data.
  abstract superclasses may not contain implementations of methods.

Question 7
0 / 1 pts
Consider the abstract superclass below:
public abstract class Foo
{
    private int a;
    public int b;

    public Foo(int aVal, int bVal)
    {
         a = aVal;
         b = bVal;
    }

    public abstract int calculate();
}
Any concrete subclass that extends class Foo:
  Must implement a method called calculate. 
You Answered
  Will not be able to access the instance variable a. 
  Neither Must implement a method called calculate nor Will not be able to access the instance variable a. 
Correct Answer
  Both Must implement a method called calculate nor Will not be able to access the instance variable a. 
 
Question 8
1 / 1 pts
Consider classes A, B and C, where A is an abstract superclass, B is a concrete class that inherits from A and C is a concrete class that inherits from B. Class A declares abstract method originalMethod, implemented in class B. Which of the following statements is true of class C?
  Method originalMethod cannot be overridden in class C-once it has been implemented in concrete class B, it is implicitly final.
  Method originalMethod must be overridden in class C, or a syntax error will occur.
  If method originalMethod is not overridden in class C but is called by an object of class C, an error occurs.
Correct!
  None of these.

Question 11
1 / 1 pts
When a superclass variable refers to a subclass object and a method is called on that object, the proper implementation is determined at execution time. What is the process of determining the correct method to call?

  early binding. 
  non-binding. 
  on-time binding. 
Correct!
  late/dynamic binding.

Correct!
  getClass 
  getInformation 
  ObjectClass 
  ObjectInformation 
 
Question 13
0 / 1 pts
Assigning a subclass reference to a superclass variable is safe ________.

  because the subclass object has an object of its superclass. 
Correct Answer
  because the subclass object is an object of its superclass. 
  only when the superclass is abstract. 
You Answered
  only when the superclass is concrete. 
 
Question 14

Correct!
  Interface can contains abstract methods, default methods, and static methods 
  Interface can be instantiated 
  Interface can only have 1 method 
Correct!
  Interface forces classes that implement it to declare all the abstract interface methods.
