Question 7

Consider the classes below, declared in the same file:
class A
{
    int a;
    public A()
   {
       a = 7;
    }
}

class B extends A
{
    int b;
    public B()
   {
        b = 8;
   }
}
Which of the statements below is false?
  Both variables a and b are instance variables. 
  After the constructor for class A executes, the variable a will have the value 7.
  After the constructor for class B executes, the variable b will have the value 8.
Correct!
  A reference of type A can be treated as a reference of type B. 
 
Question 8

  private instance variables and methods.
Correct!
  protected instance variables and methods.
  private constructors.
  protected constructors.
 
Question 9
1 / 1 pts
Which statement is true when a superclass has protected instance variables?
  A subclass object can assign an invalid value to the superclass's instance variables, thus leaving an object in an inconsistent state.
  Subclass methods are more likely to be written so that they depend on the superclass's data implementation.
  We may need to modify all the subclasses of the superclass if the superclass implementation changes. 
Correct!
  All of these. 
 
Question 10
1 / 1 pts
private fields of a superclass can be accessed in a subclass.

  directly. 
  All of these. 
 
Question 11

When a subclass constructor calls its superclass constructor, what happens if the superclass's constructor does not assign a value to an instance variable?
  A syntax error occurs. 
You Answered
  A compile-time error occurs. 
  A run-time error occurs. 
Correct Answer
  The program compiles and runs because the instance variables are initialized to their default values.
